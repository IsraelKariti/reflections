What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

when i initialize a repository a hidden directory is created. this directory holds all the information.
and everytime i use a git command such as git log or git checkout a sequence of commands. 
in contrast to 	win OS where every SW is a ton of code bundled together, in linux every command is a separate little bit of executable. so when i run git checout for example it manipulates the data in the file.
git diff by the way, and git log only observe the data in the files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

the staging area is actually just a data in the .git folder
it mentions all the files that are interesting to the user. so when a commit occures the changes are recorded
